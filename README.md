# Ride-Sharing
Ride Sharing project made for CS 480: Database Systems. Taxi data information is provided by the NYC Database, which was imported and manipulated using MySQL. Then used Juypter Notebook to determine the mileage saved and possible combination of trips to reduce waiting time and overall milage.
